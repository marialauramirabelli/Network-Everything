### _Designing Connected Products_ (Table of Contents - Chapter 1) by Claire Rowland , Elizabeth Goodman, Martin Charlier, Ann Light & Alfred Lui  
What I liked most about this reading is its awareness of the complexities of design and that it exposes how many design considerations are neglected or misunderstood in different devices that are sold today. I have experienced using devices or services that failed or were a hassle to operate because of issues that are often brought up in the book, such as interusability, interoperability, an incorrect conceptual model of how the product works, and even poor costumer service. The text points out several times that the purpose of IoT devices should be to do "something of value for people, in a way that appeals to them and makes sense" (p. 26). If a user is more frustrated with the device than they are satisfied, then the product has failed; what's the point of assigning time, resources, and work into creating something that will be deemed a nuisance?  
  
In Chapter 1, Claire Rowland mentions the story "The Lich House" by Walter Ellis, in which "a woman is unable to shoot an intruder in her home: her gun cannot contact the Internet for the authentication that would allow her to fire it" (p. 8). This is not the first hypothetical scenario of this sort that I've read about, and their value comes from the fact that as more things in our life are controlled by the Internet (the more we rely on IoT devices for our safety and wellbeing), we have to be more critical about what these forms of control imply and their risks. As Rowland describes it, "in theory, there could be unexpected consequences of things adopting Internet-like behaviors." I don't think this means we should stop using IoT devices altogether, but we have to be aware (when we design and when we purchase/consume) that the worst-case scenarios might be more serious than having/being a frustrated customer. For instance, I'm reminded of the 2016 news story of the first person to die on a self-driving car (a Tesla Model S in auto-pilot mode), when the sensors "failed to distinguish a white tractor-trailer crossing the highway against a bright sky" (https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/30/tesla-autopilot-death-self-driving-car-elon-musk).  
  
    
      
### Hypothetical Device  
A while back, I came up with an idea for a hypothetical device and imagined how it could be used in the real world, but didn't have such as explicit guidelines as the ones given in this book (pp. 21-26). My device was a real-time speech recognition and translation headband; it was to be worn by individuals who speak a language other than the official or predominant language in a community, so the purpose of the headband was to allow others to understand what this person says in their own language (the translation would be displayed on a screen on the headband).  
  
Interusability is an important aspect of it, because blind or illiterate individuals who couldn't read the headband could purchase an "ear piece" that would carry out translations through speech rather than text (the headband and the "ear pieces" would have to connect through a wireless standard such as Bluetooth, for example). Another important aspect is related to industrial design. The headband and the "ear piece" are supposed to be worn daily and constantly by the people who own them, and thus they must be easily and comfortably worn, as well as durable. In the specific case of the headband, it would have to rest on the head in such a way that people around the individual wearing it could read the text displayed on the screen (therefore, the headband would have to comfortably rest on the forehead, essentially).
