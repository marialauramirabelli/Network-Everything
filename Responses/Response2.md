### _Designing Connected Products_ (Table of Contents - Chapter 1) by Claire Rowland , Elizabeth Goodman, Martin Charlier, Ann Light & Alfred Lui  
What I liked most about this reading is its awareness of the complexities of design and that it exposes how many design considerations are neglected or misunderstood in different devices that are sold today. I have experienced using devices or services that failed or were a hassle to operate because of issues that are often brought up in the book, such as interusability, interoperability, an incorrect conceptual model of how the product works, and even poor costumer service. The text points out several times that the purpose of IoT devices should be to do "something of value for people, in a way that appeals to them and makes sense" (p. 26). If a user is more frustrated with the device than they are satisfied, then the product has failed; what's the point of assigning time, resources, and work into creating something that will be deemed a nuisance?  
  
In Chapter 1, Claire Rowland mentions the story "The Lich House" by Walter Ellis, in which "a woman is unable to shoot an intruder in her home: her gun cannot contact the Internet for the authentication that would allow her to fire it" (p. 8). This is not the first hypothetical scenario of this sort that I've read about, and their value comes from the fact that as more things in our life are controlled by the Internet (the more we rely on IoT devices for our safety and wellbeing), we have to be more critical about what these forms of control imply and their risks. As Rowland describes it, "in theory, there could be unexpected consequences of things adopting Internet-like behaviors." I don't think this means we should stop using IoT devices altogether, but we have to be aware (when we design and when we purchase/consume) that the worst-case scenarios might be more serious than having/being a frustrated customer. For instance, I'm reminded of the 2016 news story of the first person to die on a self-driving car (a Tesla Model S in auto-pilot mode), when the sensors "failed to distinguish a white tractor-trailer crossing the highway against a bright sky" (https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/30/tesla-autopilot-death-self-driving-car-elon-musk).
