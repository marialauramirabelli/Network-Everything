### _Linked_ (Chs. 1-3) by Albert-László Barabási  
As I began to read Barabási’s book, I was inevitably reminded of the first time that my dad, a psychologist, pointed out to me that many physical ailments are likely to be manifestations of psychological distress. I was about ten and that sounded like magic: how could sadness or worry (which I saw as the sole targets of psychology back then) lead to actual physiological problems? It made me think of the brain as the undisputed master of the body. But throughout the years, it’s become clear to me that conditions of the body have their effects on the brain as well.  
  
Barabási’s description of how reductionism became the predominant lens for scientific research in the twentieth century (“we have been forced to see the world through its constituents”, p. 6) explains why I was shocked by my father’s nugget of information, which challenged my view of the brain and the body as two separate entities with independent functions. The human body (including the brain) in itself is a perfect example of the complexity, sophistication, and self-organization that networks possess; having evolved for thousands of years into a system of multiple, interconnected parts that constantly interact with the goal of maintaining the individual alive, the human body is a network of networks (Barabási mentions networks of genes, neurons, other cells, etc.).  
  
I kept on thinking about this as I flipped through _Linked_'s pages, amused by how the evolution of my understanding of the body mirrored in the most basic way the history behind our current understanding of networks, of their presence in all aspects of our lives and of the roles they play. And as interesting as networks are in an of themselves, what makes them particularly fascinating is the fact that despite their ubiquity in our environment and our reality, we have struggled to fully understand them because of the challenges they pose to our traditional world view. As Barabási says at the end of “Six Degrees of Separation”: “Navigating this non-Euclidean world repeatedly tricks our intuition and reminds us that there is a new geometry out there that we need to master in order to make sense of the complex world around us” (p. 40).
