## 2nd Version of the Code
This is the second set of files related to the Connected Device assignment; I've worked more on the code but it's still not entirely functional. I've mostly focused on the logic of the browser as data input for new users, but there's still a lot to do in terms of client-server communication. I also haven't gotten to figuring out how to implement nodemailer or any other ways of sending emails, which is essential for my project.  
  
The following are a system diagram (which is vague, it doesn't address HTTP requests as the example in the book *Making Things Talk* does, for I wasn't sure how to include these) and a logic flow chart (which can be improved to be more specific and clearer). I'm missing the schematic for the Arduino circuit (to be posted soon).
