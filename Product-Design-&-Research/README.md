### Motion detection and tracking for elders who live on their own 
  
  
**Product Definition**  
  
What is the value proposition? What problem does it solve?  
* In many societies, elders are left to live on their own once their children have grown up and settled with their own families in other cities/countries. When this happens, the elderly often have no supervision and no way of alerting others when an emergency occurs.  
  
What is the target market?  
* Elderly people who live on their own.  
* Their family members who can’t live close to them but want to make sure they are safe.  
* Any health system that would have an interest in implementing automated geriatric care (would work as a hotline for hospitals, healthcare services, etc.).  

Is it a product or a tool? Is it a service?  
* It is both a product and a service; the motion sensing/tracking device would be a product designed for a specific purpose, and a service would be provided once the product triggers a response (what happens when an elderly person is sensed as not having moved for a while? What happens if an elderly person is tracked outside of their usual locations?).  
  
Define the actors and stakeholders  
* Actors: The elderly who are using the product / family members in charge of the product
* Stakeholders: emergency service (ambulance), hospitals/clinics, police force, people who give maintenance to the device
* Initially, the family members who purchase the product are the only individuals allowed to constantly monitor the elderly person; the institutions/people listed as stakeholders are only alerted when a problem has occurred. If the family members want the hospital, etc. to be able to constantly monitor the elderly person though, they can grant that permission and the hospital, etc. becomes an actor, more directly responsible for the elderly person’s well-being.
  
What is the context?   
* *Operational*: it should be able to operate in a variety of settings, given the user will constantly be wearing the device, and it should be comfortably and securely worn (user shouldn’t be taking it off constantly, as it could trigger false alarms); should be waterproof and very durable; should be easy to fix, change batteries, etc.
* *Behavioural*: (time and place) the device should “learn” the routine and frequented places of each individual (which varies by person); it should also “learn” how much a person moves/is active on average, such that when it detects/tracks activity that is below average, it can trigger an alert; (proximity and visibility) not everyone can access the information, only close family members and whoever else those family members have granted permission to; (states of being) it should be very user-friendly and straightforward, the user themselves don’t need to interact much with it, essentially they only wear it (unless they want to trigger an alarm themselves, but the design for triggering your own alarm should minimize accidental alarms), but for the people monitoring the user, the interface that shows information from the device should be easy to understand and interpret, and the alerts triggered by the device should be clear and immediate.
*	*Sociocultural*: the device shouldn’t be too obvious/visible, as there is a sigma against the vulnerability of the elderly which can have a psychological impact on the person; the user shouldn’t feel self-conscious about wearing the device
*	*Ecological*: the device would work with the emergency hotline as a telephone or smartphone would, with no need of implementing a new system; the information checked by the family/other people with access would live on an app for smartphones or a website with login requirements; on the app/website, a map to show the location could be implemented with Google Maps or other existing location apps
  
**Research**
  
What questions would you ask in an interview?  
* What would be comfortable to wear?
* To trigger an alarm, would you prefer a physical button or a button on a screen? (we would have to consider minimizing accidental button presses)
*	What does your schedule look like? How much activity do you do/have in a day? (this would help us have an average to set in the system)
*	Would you feel safer or not  knowing your family can monitor you? Knowing a hospital can monitor you? Or would you feel uncomfortable with having that information be seen by others?
*	Would you like the device to give you visible or audible information about yourself? Or would you rather not worry and let your family handle it?
*	What should an app for this look like?
*	Would you like to access information through security checks (passwords, etc.) or more immediately than that?
*	Should alarms be triggered automatically for healthcare/emergency services or should alarms go through you first?
  
How would you approach making? What would you make? What method would you use?
*	It would be good to involve elderly potential-users involved throughout the prototyping process to consider mattes of comfort (size, material, etc.), interaction and usability, etc. as they would be wearing the device constantly; similarly, the same would be done with family members regarding the development of an app, etc.
*	Research into existing products for the elderly, consultation with geriatricians and gerontologists
